reedy Best-First Search is a search algorithm used in pathfinding and graph traversal that employs a heuristic approach to find the most promising node to expand next. Here’s a breakdown of its key features:

Key Concepts
Heuristic Function:
Open List:

Greedy Best-First Search maintains an open list (often implemented as a priority queue) that contains nodes to be explored. Nodes are sorted based on their heuristic values.
The node with the lowest heuristic value is expanded first.
Expansion:

The algorithm expands the node with the lowest heuristic value, exploring its neighbors and adding them to the open list if they haven’t been visited yet.
This process continues until the goal node is reached or the open list is empty.
Characteristics
Non-Optimal: Greedy Best-First Search does not guarantee an optimal solution. It may find a path that is not the shortest due to its focus on the heuristic alone, rather than the overall cost.
Fast: It is often faster than uninformed search algorithms like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search, especially when the heuristic is effective.
Memory Usage: It can consume a lot of memory because it stores all nodes in the open list, especially in large graphs.


Applications
Pathfinding: Used in navigation systems and AI in games to find routes efficiently.
AI Problem Solving: Applicable in various AI problems where a heuristic can guide the search.
Summary
Greedy Best-First Search is a heuristic search algorithm that prioritizes exploration based on estimated costs to the goal. While it can be faster than other search methods and is useful for finding quick solutions, it does not guarantee optimality. The effectiveness of the algorithm largely depends on the quality of the heuristic used.
